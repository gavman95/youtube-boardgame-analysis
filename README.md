## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Playing board games is one of my favorite hobbies when spending time with friends and family. I love the problem-solving, creative thinking, teamwork, and competitive nature involved in playing board games. Especially when trying out a new game for the first time, the anticipation and understanding of how the game is designed are intriguing. I wanted to search for a YouTube channel centered around board games in the hopes of watching friendly competitive games and discovering any new board games that might interest me.

Four channels I came across, which I was interested in, are Acualol, The Dice Tower, Good Time Society & No Rolls Barred.

### Aims, Objectives, and Background <a name="aims-objectives-and-background"></a>

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

* Exploring how the YouTube API works and how to retrieve video data.
* Analyzing the data of the videos and exploring some questions, for example:
  * Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
  * Top 10 videos based on views.
  * Subscriber count.
  * What has been the upload schedule throughout each channel's history?
* Explore NLP techniques using sentiment analysis.
  * Which popular themes are uncovered in the videos.
  * Based on the comments section, what is the sentiment of the videos?
  * What inquiries are being posed in the comment sections of the videos?
  * How have the videos exploring the game Decrypto been received by viewers based on the comments?

### Subscriber Count <a name="subscriber-count"></a>

Just to get things started off, I wanted to create a plot of the channels and their subscribers count. As we can see, The Dice Tower is the most followed channel at 334K, followed by No Rolls Barred at 320K, then Actualol at 106K, with Good Time Society being the least followed out of the four channels at 58.1K.
