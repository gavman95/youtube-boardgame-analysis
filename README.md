# Exploaratory Data Analysis of 4 Board Game Youtube Channels 

1. **Aims, objectives and background**

Playing board games is one of my favourite hobbies when spending time with friends and family. I love the problem solving, creative thinking, teamwork, competitive nature when playing any board games. Especially whenever you get to try out a new game for the first time, the anticipation and understanding of how the game is designed is intriguing. I wanted to search for a youtube channel that was centered around board games in the hopes of seeing some friendly competitive games as well as obviously discovering any new board games that might interest me.

 Four channels I came across which I was interested in was Acualol, The Dice Tower, Good Time Society & No Rolls Barred.

1.1 **Aims and objectives**
 
 Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

* Exploring how the Youtube API works and how to retrieve video data.
* Analyzing the data of the videos and exploring some questions, for example:
  * Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
  * Top 10 videos based of views
  * Subscriber count
  * What has been the upload schedule throughout each channels history?
* Explore NLP techniques using sentiment analysis
  * Which popular themes are uncovered in the videos
  * Based of the comments section, what is the sentiment of the videos?
  * What inquiries are being posed in the comment sections of the videos?
  * How has the videos exploring the game Decrypto received by viewers based of the comments?

After exploring these topics, my end goal would be to help identify the best 2 channels I preferrably would follow
